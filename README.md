# Drawing-App

In this side project I got a customer who wanted to get an app where can draw into small squares, to design cool images for knitting.

## Features

Drawing-App v.0.1:

    Six different color to draw
    Rubber, to delete pixel by pixel
    Clean-page option

The finished product have a .exe file what I won't upload here but to make a new one just ```pip install pyinstaller```.

In the file have a settings option where can customize the FPS, Screen-size etc.

This was a great opportunity to learn more about Python and it's powerful methods.

### How to run it?

After you cloned the repo just go to ***main.py*** and hit run button of your VS code.
