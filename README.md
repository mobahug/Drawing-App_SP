# Drawing-App

In this side project I got a customer who wanted to get an app where can draw into small squares, to design cool images for knitting.

The app first version having six different color, a rubber to delete pixel by pixel, and a clear page option.
The finished product have a .exe file what I won't upload here but to make a new one just ```pip install pyinstaller```.
In the file have a settings option whre can customize the FPS, Scree-size etc.

This was a great opportunity to learn more about Python and it's powerful methods.
